# Tensorflow Handwriting Analysis
Utilizes tensorflow to build a deep learning model for predicting the number contained in images of handwritten numbers. This program builds a model, then trains and evaluates it and then makes predictions on test data using the model. Code is written in python and uses the MNIST database for the handwritten images.
