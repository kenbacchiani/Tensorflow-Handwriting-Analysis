# Tensorflow Handwriting Analysis
Utilizes tensorflow to build a deep learning model for predicting the number contained in images of handwritten numbers. This program builds a model, then trains, evaluates it, and makes predictions on test data using this model. Code is written in python and uses the MNIST database for the handwritten images.
